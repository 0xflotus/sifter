# Additions
		
	BetterSafetyKatz - Modified fork of SafetyKatz dynamically patching runtime, based on detected signatures
                          using SharpSploit DInvoke to get it into memory
	
	CVE-2018-8120 - Added for Privilege Escalation of a target session
	
	WebMap - Provides a graphical webpanel to interact with nMap

	ThreatCheck - Takes a binary as input (either from a file on disk or a URL), splits it until it pinpoints 
				  that exact bytes that the target engine will flag on and prints them to the screen. This can be helpful 
				  when trying to identify the specific bad pieces of code in your tool/payload.

	Snaffler - Gather Windows computers from Active Directory, then searches out file shares, and whether you can read them.

	WeblogicScanner - weblogic Vulnerability Scanning Tool
